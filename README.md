# Your-Local-Barbershop project

Your local barbershop is a modern, blocky affair with a mobile-style menu, fully responsive styling,
and an assortment of elements.

- It's built with components from my Responsive Tools project.

- It uses flexbox, which eliminates all kinds of terrible hacks and clunky layout
  stopgaps (like CSS grid systems).
